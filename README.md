# Nike+ Sport Watch GPS GNU/Linux module

## Information about source code original author
The source code of this repository is fully based on this other project https://sourceforge.net/projects/comsport/ its author is Raúl Jiménez Benítez. (rajibe@gmail.com), I just keep his files and his notes.

## Targets
The main target of this project is to adapt the sourceforge project code to have a functional kernel module to be able to manage my Nike+ Sport Watch on my Debian GNU/Linux testing (buster). A secondary target would be re-design source code to be more extensible to make easier adapt it to other models.

[I started this personal project long time ago and I take some notes about some changes that I made in source code in my blog.](https://neklaf.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/installing-nike-sportwatch-linux-driver/)

This GitHub repo is just to put things together and try to achieve a functional version someday.
